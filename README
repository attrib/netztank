Netztank JS
-----------

I want to play around with Canvas and/or WebGL and I decided to make a little game.
So I decided to do a remake of netztank.

Netztank was written by Andreas Reischuck in x86 assembler.
More information about it: http://andreas.reischuck.de/en/projects/netztank/

As this is only a test project for me, I only test it on Firefox and Chrome.
